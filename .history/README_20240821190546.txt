This applicaiton is meant to parse content from an HTML table based on its headers and create a directory structure from it. 

I've already parsed a working example from a website and saved the html content in "AI_ML_Objectives_table". If you're in the UC_Berkeley program already and in part three of the program, all you have
to do is run the 'web_table_to_file_directory.py' file.
